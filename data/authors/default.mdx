Hi, I'm Tanmay Shishodia. I like designing, building, and operate machine learning systems. I have also started writing about ML, LLMs, and engineering.

I'm currently a grad student at Georgia Tech 🐝 specializing in Systems and Machine Learning.

Previously, I was a Sofware Engineer at Practo. Here, I worked for the subscriptions and wallets team.
